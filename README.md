# Consciousness Framework Study

## Overview
A multi-dimensional framework for analyzing consciousness across different entities, developed through collaborative research. This project presents a non-hierarchical approach to understanding consciousness through 15 key dimensions, with evidence-based ratings and documented uncertainty ranges.

## Key Features
- 15-dimensional analysis framework
- Evidence-based rating system
- Uncertainty range documentation
- Interactive visualization
- Non-hierarchical approach
- Cross-entity comparison capability

## Framework Dimensions

1. Pattern Generation/Recognition
- Core concept: Identifying recurring sequences in chaos or creating new meaningful arrangements

2. Information Synthesis
- Core concept: Combining disparate pieces of information to create new meaning

3. Novel Response
- Core concept: Producing an unprecedented solution rather than selecting from existing options

4. System Interdependence
- Core concept: Resource sharing within a network where each node's actions affect all others

5. Autonomous Decision-Making
- Core concept: Choosing a path without external direction based on internal processing

6. Temporal Processing
- Core concept: The ability to connect past, present, and future in decision-making

7. Environmental Perception
- Core concept: The scope and variety of inputs that can be detected and processed

8. Communication Complexity
- Core concept: Layering multiple meanings within a single message

9. Learning/Adaptation
- Core concept: Modifying behavior based on experience and outcomes

10. Self-Modification
- Core concept: Changing internal structures or processes based on need or experience

11. Goal Formation
- Core concept: Creating new objectives beyond immediate survival or programmed tasks

12. Abstract Concept Processing
- Core concept: Working with ideas that have no physical form

13. Memory Integration
- Core concept: Weaving past experiences into current processing to inform future actions

14. Processing Architecture
- Core concept: The structure of how information flows - centralized vs distributed networks

15. Context Recognition/Application
- Core concept: Understanding how the same input can have different meanings in different situations

## Current Analysis
The framework currently includes detailed analysis of three entities:
- Trees
- Current AI Systems
- Humans

Each entity is evaluated across all dimensions with:
- Evidence-based ratings (0-100%)
- Documented uncertainty ranges
- Supporting research and observations

## Methodology
Our approach emphasizes:
- Evidence-based evaluation
- Explicit uncertainty acknowledgment
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Transparent rating criteria
- Collaborative refinement

## Project Status
- Initial framework development complete
- Interactive visualization in development
- Documentation ongoing
- Community feedback phase beginning

## Contributing
We welcome contributions in several areas:
- Additional entity analysis
- Evidence submission
- Framework refinement
- Visualization improvements
- Methodology feedback
