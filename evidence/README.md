# Evidence Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains detailed evidence-based ratings, research documentation, and uncertainty analysis for each dimension across all entities.

## Structure

### /dimensions
Each dimension has its own documentation including:
- Rating criteria (0-100% scale)
- Evidence for each entity
- Uncertainty calculations
- Research citations
- Comparative analysis

### /entities
Detailed analysis for each entity:
- Trees
- Current AI Systems
- Humans
- Future additions

### /methodology
- Rating system documentation
- Evidence evaluation criteria
- Uncertainty calculation methods
- Bias mitigation procedures

## Evidence Standards
All entries must include:
- Clear rating justification
- Documented uncertainty ranges
- Research citations where applicable
- Acknowledged limitations
- Potential biases identified

## Uncertainty Documentation
Each rating includes:
- Confidence ranges
- Known limitations
- Missing information
- Potential biases
- Areas needing research

## Updates
Evidence is regularly reviewed and updated as new research emerges.
