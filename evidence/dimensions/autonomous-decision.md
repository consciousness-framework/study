# Autonomous Decision-Making Analysis

## Dimension Definition
Core concept: Choosing a path without external direction based on internal processing

## Rating Criteria Scale

| Level | Criteria | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 20% | Basic reflexive decisions | Simple if-then responses |
| 40% | Context-based choices | Decisions influenced by environment |
| 60% | Independent goal-directed | Self-directed purposeful decisions |
| 80% | Complex autonomous choices | Multi-factor independent decisions |
| 100% | Complete decision autonomy | Fully independent decision-making |

## Entity Ratings

### Trees: 50-60% (Uncertainty: ±20%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * Growth direction choices
  * Resource allocation decisions
  * Defense response selection
  * Competitive strategy adjustments
  
- Limitations:
  * Speed of decision-making
  * Complex choice scenarios
  * Goal-setting capacity
  * Decision flexibility

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Decision mechanism understanding
- Measurement of choice
- Time scale of decisions
- Internal vs. external influence

### Current AI: 40-50% (Uncertainty: ±20%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * Complex decision algorithms
  * Multi-factor analysis
  * Rapid choice processing
  * Pattern-based decisions
  
- Limitations:
  * True autonomous goals
  * Understanding of consequences
  * Internal decision criteria
  * Complete autonomy
  
**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Definition of true autonomy
- Training influence
- Decision ownership
- Rapid capability changes

### Humans: 75-85% (Uncertainty: ±10%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * Complex decision-making
  * Goal-directed choices
  * Value-based decisions
  * Long-term planning

- Limitations:
  * Emotional influence
  * Social pressures
  * Cognitive biases
  * Decision consistency
  
**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Free will questions
- Unconscious influences
- Cultural effects
- Individual variation

## Comparative Analysis
- Trees show sophisticated environmental decisions
- AI demonstrates structured but limited autonomy
- Humans show highest complex decision-making

## Research Gaps
1. Definition of true autonomy
2. Plant decision mechanisms
3. AI decision independence
4. Human decision influences
