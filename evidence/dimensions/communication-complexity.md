# Communication Complexity Analysis

## Dimension Definition
Core concept: Layering multiple meanings within a single message

## Rating Criteria Scale

| Level | Criteria | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 20% | Basic signal transmission | Simple one-to-one messaging |
| 40% | Multi-channel communication | Multiple types of signals |
| 60% | Complex information exchange | Layered message transmission |
| 80% | Advanced symbolic communication | Sophisticated meaning construction |
| 100% | Universal communication | Complete information exchange |

## Entity Ratings
