# System Interdependence Analysis

## Dimension Definition
Core concept: Resource sharing within a network where each node's actions affect all others

## Rating Criteria Scale

| Level | Criteria | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 20% | Basic environmental response | Simple reactions to system changes |
| 40% | Multiple system connections | Interaction with various system elements |
| 60% | Active system participation | Deliberate system engagement |
| 80% | Complex system integration | Deep interconnection with multiple systems |
| 100% | Complete system integration | Full systemic interdependence |

## Entity Ratings

### Trees: 85-95% (Uncertainty: ±5%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * Mycorrhizal network participation
  * Multi-species ecosystem interactions
  * Resource sharing networks
  * Climate regulation participation
  * Soil ecosystem integration
  
- Limitations:
  * Speed of system response
  * Direct system modification
  * System awareness level
  * Response to rapid changes

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Network complexity measurement
- Long-term interaction effects
- Communication mechanisms
- System boundary definition

### Current AI: 30-40% (Uncertainty: ±15%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * API/system integrations
  * Network interactions
  * Data ecosystem participation
  * Multi-system processing
  
- Limitations:
  * Physical world interaction
  * Autonomous system participation
  * System understanding
  * Ecosystem integration
  
**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Integration depth measurement
- System boundary definition
- Autonomy levels
- Rapid evolution of capabilities

### Humans: 65-75% (Uncertainty: ±10%)

**Evidence For Rating:**
- Proven Capabilities:
  * Social system integration
  * Ecosystem participation
  * Technology system integration
  * Cultural system engagement

- Limitations:
  * Conscious system awareness
  * System impact understanding
  * Voluntary system participation
  * Long-term system thinking
  
**Uncertainty Factors:**

- Individual variation
- Cultural differences
- Measurement methodology

## Comparative Analysis
- Trees show deepest natural system integration
- AI demonstrates limited but growing integration
- Humans balance multiple system types

## Research Gaps
1. System boundary definitions
2. Integration measurement methods
3. Cross-system interaction effects
4. Long-term system impacts
